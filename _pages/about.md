Hi there! üëã

My name is **Alex**, and I am a Software Engineer with over a decade of expertise in technology and software development. My journey began around 2010, and since then, I have had the privilege of working in various roles that have shaped my skills and understanding of the industry.

Currently, I‚Äôm located in Galicia ‚ù§Ô∏è (Spain), where I serve as Backend Chapter Lead at <a href="https://sngular.com" target="_blank">Sngular</a>, where I support our engineers and contribute to business development and project proposals. My technical expertise encompasses **backend development**, **DevOps**, and **Quality Engineering**, and I have held roles as a Tech Lead and Solutions Architect on various projects.

Throughout my career, I have built a strong foundation in creating large-scale solutions. My early work involved developing document management systems using <a href="https://docs.alfresco.com/">Alfresco Software</a>, focusing on performance audits and technical training. As I progressed, I contributed to projects like <a href="https://www.gbtec.com/software/">BIC Cloud Workflow and BIC Cloud GRC</a>, playing around with workflow process design and risk management.

My recent experiences in the financial sector in the US have been particularly rewarding. In Pittsburgh, I designed and built a real-time stock exchange application for **PNC Bank**, utilizing **Kafka** and Confluent. I also collaborated with **Capital One** in Washington, DC, to enhance their **MFA login infrastructure**. Additionally, I worked with **Freddie Mac** to help them **adopt Contract Testing across their whole organization**. This last one led me to a continuous collaboration with SmartBear, especially regarding their <a href="https://pactflow.io/">PactFlow</a> product. Many of the articles and live events you‚Äôll find here are related to contract testing practice.
